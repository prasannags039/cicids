CICIDS 2017 Dataset – Intrusion Detection Project

This repository contains a simple and human-friendly explanation of my work using the **CICIDS 2017 dataset**, a real-world collection of network traffic that includes both normal activity and different types of cyberattacks.

About the Dataset

The CICIDS 2017 dataset was created to simulate modern network behavior. It includes:

* Normal traffic
* Various attack types (like DDoS, Brute Force, Port Scans, and more)

This makes it a great dataset for learning and testing intrusion detection models.

Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to understand the dataset, analyze patterns, and build models that can detect abnormal or malicious network activity.

What This Project Includes

* A clear walkthrough of the dataset
* Data cleaning and preparation steps
* Model training and evaluation
* Simple explanations suitable for beginners

Highlights

* Focus on practical understanding rather than complex theory
* Clean and readable approach
* Useful for learning cybersecurity and machine learning basics

Acknowledgment

Dataset by the **Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)**.

Feel free to update or expand this as the project grows!
